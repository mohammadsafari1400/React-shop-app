      A T-shirt, or tee shirt, is a style of fabric shirt named after the T
      shape of its body and sleeves. Traditionally, it has short sleeves and a
      round neckline, known as a crew neck, which lacks a collar. T-shirts are
      generally made of a stretchy, light, and inexpensive fabric and are easy
      to clean. The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century
      and, in the mid-20th century, transitioned from undergarment to
      general-use casual clothing.
